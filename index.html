        <h2>some things i do</h2>
        
        <br>
        <h3>application modernisation</h3>
        <code>#b2b</code>
        <p>4 years ago i started as a delivery engineer for modernization products at <a href="https://www.rocketsoftware.com/product-categories/application-modernization">Rocket Software</a>. today i lead a team of Delivery Engineers, who build <strong>web-</strong> and <strong>api-based</strong> applications for multiple customers.</p>
        <p>each project has a unique set of requirements for UI/UX, integration capabilities and performance. many of those requirements are discovered during the course of multiple project sprints in a close collaboration with the customer tech team and the end users.</p>
        <p>i lead the team to deliver value to the customer based on their business needs. i take an agile approach and focus on delivering most important features first, as well as involving the business into the testing phase early in the project.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>cross-functional leadership</h3>
        <p>all of my roles include various levels of involvement with cross-functional teams.</p>
        <p>i have led and participated in CFT that consist of a wide range of stakeholders: product teams, sales and account management, customer experience and support, executive sponsors, marketing and more.</p>
        <p>this work has always been taking a significant part of my role(s) and helped me develop stakeholder management skills and deep understanding of different functions and their priorities.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>diversity inclusion equity</h3>
        <code>#internal</code>
        <p>social justice is super important to me, and outside of my day job at Rocket Software i lead a team of volunteers who believe in Diversity, Inclusion and Equity and strive to make Rocket Software the most inclusive tech company out there.</p>
        <p>among many projects that we run: corporate guide to inclusive communication, community events, product accessibility initiative and <a href="https://www.rocketsoftware.com/ride">more</a>.</p>
        <p>i also sometimes speak at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9lv4TN2dHQ&list=PL8REpLGaY9QH3kKxJrYxEbRl45UUzNvAN&index=1">DEI events</a>. i’m proud of this work and it allows me to make the world a better place.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h3>digital transformation program</h3>
        <code>#internal</code>
        <p><a href="https://enclub.ru/">The English Club</a> &mdash; a successful school of languages in Chelyabinsk, Russia (my home town) &mdash; was in need of digital transformation that would streamline all customer operations and bring them together in one place.</p>
        <p>In 2018-2019 I led a project that involved 7 different functions and affected 5000+ customers in how they interact with The English Club. this effort has reduced the manual work of customer experience and accounting teams by half.</p>
        <p>The project took two years from scoping, planning & selecting vendors to implementation, rollout and user adoption. It was completed on budget, and the outcomes of it have been operational ever since.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h3>year-round youth education camp</h3>
        <code>#b2c</code>
        <p>in my very first job as a camp leader in <a href="https://4-u.ru/">kids camp</a>, i was continuously looking for ways of making processes more efficient and implementing features that help improve kids’ experience.</p>
        <p>when i left it 9 years later it was an award-winning education program for kids with agile internal processes, 99% customer satisfaction and an inspired team ready to take it to the next level.</p>
